# Forecasting-power-consumption
Forecasting power consumption and Data visualization of Regional Load Despatch Centre (NERLDC)


Overview
This project aims to forecast power consumption and visualize the data for the Regional Load Despatch Centre (NERLDC). The dataset used in this project is Data_set.csv, which contains historical power consumption data. The forecasting model implemented in this project is based on the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, a widely used statistical method for time series forecasting.

The analysis and forecasting are implemented in a Jupyter Notebook file named Forecasting-power-consumption.ipynb.
